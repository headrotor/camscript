#As of 2020 this is OBSOLETE
Gphoto2 does not work with new Canon point-and-shoots, Python 2 is deprecated as well. 
Blip.tv is defunct and I don't trust Flickr with new data. 
Please see new repository at https://github.com/headrotor/cam3

Code to produce timelapse videos from a camera using gphoto2 and ffmpeg.
